            <p class="signupbold"> What are the specs needed for the desktop? </p>
            <p class="signupsmall"> Any PC made for gaming will do, as stronger PCs are essential for things like video editing, 3D, and etc. Gaming PCs tend to fit this mark as they have higher RAM, better CPU power, and a better GPU for rendering and processing media smoothly. 1TB or higher storage would be good as well to ensure it lasts as long as it can.</p>
